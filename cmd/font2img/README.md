# font2img

Providing intreactive prompts to help people who want to post blog but could not draw picture as blog banner. So using the blog-title as the banner maybe be a good idea. However I could not found the property tool for me (a developer)..., why not recreating one with personal ideas ?

it has following features:

* font to img (basic feature)
* image format suport multi types(jpeg, png)
* background config suuport (color, image)
* custom font choosing
* font config suuport (color, size, bold, etc)
